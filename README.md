#Setup
Download the project files and then rename config.sample.js => config.js and fill in the appropriate credentials.

The callback I used was:
```
http://localhost:7000/auth/google/callback
```

Then, run the following commands from the project root folder in terminal:
```
npm install
bower install
npm start
```
